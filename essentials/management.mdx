## Pursuits

Pursuits help you organize opportunities you're interested in bidding on. In order to create a pursuit, search for contracts and click the `Create Pursuit` button when you find something you want to bid on. You can view and manage all the pursuits you've created by clicking the top left menu button and pressing pursuits.

## Tasks

Tasks help you organize the granular aspects of the bidding process and promote team collaboration. To get started, click on a pursuit you've created, navigate to the tasks section, and press the `+ Add Task` button. Fill out any information you wish to include and then create the task.

You can click the arrow button at the top right of any task card in order to easily view all of its information. From there, you can also comment on progress and respond to feedback. Whenever you're ready to update the status of the task, drag and drop the task cards into the respective columns.

## Documents

See `Proposal Writer`.
## Files

Files contain the list of official documents attached to the RFP along with anything else that you have uploaded in the documents section.
