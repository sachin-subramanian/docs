### Features
- **Conversational Interaction**: Query the document as if you were asking a colleague. The more detailed you are, the better it will be able to understand what you're looking for.
- **Knowledge/Reasoning**: Sweetspot AI thinks before it responds, ensuring you get accurate information. Hover over the knowledge icon to view the reasoning provided for each message in your chat thread.
- **Markdown Support**: Organize information into digestable markdown format (e.g. tables, lists, etc.) by appending 'as markdown' (or similar) to a query. For example, you may want to organize deadlines for an opportunity into a table, which can be accomplished by appending 'into a table' or 'in tabular form' to your query. If applicable, scroll to the right of any generated table to reveal a copy button, allowing you to copy and paste the table into any document editor.
- **Keyword Search**: Use `Cmd/Ctrl + f` to quickly find keywords within the currently opened solicitation file. Or, click on the magnifying glass on the left-hand side of the file viewer toolbar (located at the bottom of the page) to toggle the search interface.![OC Search](/images/ocsearch.png)
- **Zoom**: Adjust the view by zooming in with `+` and out with `-` in the file viewer. This is located on the right-hand side of the file viewer toolbar.
- **File Select**: Navigate through the solicitation files by clicking on the file selector dropdown at the top of the file viewer. ![OC Files](/images/ocfiles.png)
- **Download**: Download the currently opened file by clicking on the download icon on the right-hand side of the file viewer toolbar. If you'd like to download all files as a `zip` file, navigate to the thread sidebar, open the thread options menu for the thread you're currently on, click `View Opportunity`, and scroll to the bottom of the page. There will be a button to download all files as a `zip` file. Alternatively, click on the title of the thread/opportunity at the top of the Sweetspot navigation bar (at the top of the page) - this will take you directly to the opportunity you're chatting about, where you can download a `zip`, as above.
