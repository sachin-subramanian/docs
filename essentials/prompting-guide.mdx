## Prompting Guide

When using Sweetspot's AI powered search, Chat with PDF, or AI proposal writing features, this guide walks you through best practices for successful product use. 

### Search Guide
- Avoid acronyms when searching. While the search can often deconstruct these, it's not infallible.
- Detail is critical. The more detailed your query, the better the search results.
- Filters are your friends for specific information. Presently, directly entering in your solicitation numbers or NAICS codes in the search bar will not yield the best results.
<tip>The best way to filter for solicitation numbers, PSC codes, NAICS codes, buyers, or anything similar, use the built-in filter function and leave the search query blank.</tip>

### Chat Interface

- The Sweetspot AI is agentic, which means that it can choose the best tools to answer your questions based on the context it has gathered.
- For the AI to perform a search, explicitly ask it to do so with "search".
- Specificity matters. For instance, "section L instructions" will produce better outcomes than just "section L".

### Using the Proposal Writer

- Begin with the Outline Generator to create a structured outline for your proposal. You can also provide custom instructions as part of the outline generator. 
- Communicate your needs in detail. Instead of "write my proposal", provide specifics such as "write my technical approach with win themes focusing on x and y".
- Use inline chat to insert text into your document and document chat for brainstorming or asking questions. Highlight and right-click text to interact with these features.
- Segment your files correctly to ensure the AI can utilize the PursuitSearch, OrganizationSearch, and WebSearch effectively.

### Focusing the AI's Search

- To search within your organization, prompt with: `Search within my organization with ...`
- To search within the pursuit, prompt with: `Search within my pursuit with ...`
- To combine both searches, prompt with: `Search within the pursuit and organization ...`

### Web Search

- To use the internet for information, prompt with:
  `Use the internet to lookup ...`
- You can also perform multihop queries such as:
  `Use my pursuit files and also web search...`
