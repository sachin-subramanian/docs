## Schedules

Schedules automate the process of search queries on a daily or weekly interval. They allow users to stay updated with the latest opportunities without the need to manually perform searches each time. Here`s how you can utilize Schedules effectively:

### Creating a Schedule

To create a schedule:

1. Navigate to the `Schedules` section of the platform.
2. Click on the `+ Create Schedule` button.
3. In the pop-up window, define your `Query` by entering keywords, phrases, or specific criteria.
4. Select the `Schedule` interval, choosing either `Daily` or `Weekly` updates.
5. Apply any additional filters needed to tailor your search further.
6. Click `Create Schedule` to activate it.

Your search criteria will be saved, and you will receive automated search results in your email inbox at the chosen interval.

### Managing Schedules

Once your schedules are set, you can:

- **Run Search**: Instantly perform the search associated with a particular schedule.
- **Edit**: Update or modify the search criteria and frequency of a schedule.
- **Delete**: Remove a schedule that you no longer need.

### Applying Filters to Schedules

You can apply a variety of filters to each schedule to narrow down your search:
- **Status**: Choose to view either `Active Only` or `Inactive Only` contracts.
- **Dates**: Filter by `Due Date` or `Posted Date` to find contracts that match your timeline.
- **Solicitation Number(s)**: Enter specific numbers to search for certain contracts.
- **Buyer(s)**: Look for contracts by naming the government department or agency.
- **Notice Type(s)**: Specify the notice type to streamline your search.
- **NAICS Code(s)**, **PSC Code(s)**, and **Set Aside Code(s)**: Use these codes to find opportunities relevant to your industry and services.
Each of these filters can be selected or deselected to refine the search results your schedule will deliver.

### Removing Filters

To remove a filter from an existing schedule, simply edit the schedule and uncheck the selected filter. This adjustment will be reflected in the subsequent results you receive.

### Interval and Delivery

The interval of each schedule can be easily identified in the `Interval` column on your schedules list, allowing you to know exactly when to expect your next set of results. This automated service ensures that you don`t miss out on any potential opportunities and can respond to relevant contracts in a timely manner.
