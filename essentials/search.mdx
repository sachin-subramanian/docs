## Generative Search
Sweetspot leverages generative search in order to dynamically recommend you the most relevant contracts. Generative search is capable of interpreting keywords, acronyms, and specific phrases - ensuring that no opportunities slip through the cracks. <Tip> Fill out your organization profile to best take advantage of generative search. </Tip>

## Filter Search

To perform a filter search:

1. Select any filter.
2. Leave the search bar empty and press Enter.

<Tip> For example, if you want to find a list of all 8A contracts, select 8A as a filter under `Set Aside Codes`, leave the search box blank, and press `Enter`. </Tip>
