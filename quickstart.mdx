<Tip>
Examples of good files to upload are capabilities statements, past responses to RFPs, and resumes.
</Tip>
<Info> When you upload any new files, you’ll get a loading wheel. You won’t be able to access those files until the loading wheel disappears. It can take 1-2 mins to index each file, based on the size.</Info>

## 4.  Manage the pursuit

Click the menu icon on the top left and select the pursuits button. Click the name of the pursuit you just added. 

Here, you can manage all aspects of the pursuit such as creating and assigning tasks to teammates, viewing recent activity, viewing pursuit files, checking compliance items, and responding to the pursuit itself. 

On the overview page, click the `+` button next to My Tasks to create your first task. Once finished, head over to the tasks tab to view the task card. 

Click the arrow button at the top right of the card in order to view the full task info. You can use this section to comment on progress and collaborate with teammates throughout the pursuit's lifecycle. As you work through each task, you can drag and drop the task card to update its status.

## 5.  Draft a response

Navigate to the documents tab on the pursuit manager. From here, create a new document just as you would on Microsoft Word or Google Docs. After creating the document, click into it to view the text editor.

This is where you can leverage Sweetspot's AI powered features in order to respond to the RFx. Our AI looks at the pursuit documents and automatically generates a compliance matrix, so that you know exactly what to address in your proposal. Click the checklist icon on the righthand side of your screen in order to view the compliance items as you're drafting the proposal. Our AI also ingests your organization profile that you filled out from Step 1 in order to help you generate responses to each section from the RFx, which you can also use on the right-hand side of your screen.
