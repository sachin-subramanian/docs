## 2.  Setup your organization profile

 Your organization profile will be used by our AI to match you with the most relevant opportunities and help you craft proposals with ease.
 
 To get it set up, click the menu icon on the top left and select the profile button. Here, you can input information about your organization such as a description, NAICS Code(s), PSC Code(s), and any relevant files.

<Tip>
Examples of good files to upload are capabilities statements, past responses to RFPs, and resumes.

## 3.  Search for contracts and make a bid/no bid decision

Click the menu icon on the top left and select the search button. Select the `Use Profile Filters` button under the filters section to automatically add your organization profile info.

Type in your query into the search bar and explore the results. Click on any of the search results in order to get more information about the opportunity. You can even press the `Chat` button in order to ask our AI questions about the contract.

Once you decide that you want to bid on the contract, click the `Create Pursuit` button.

## 4.  Manage the pursuit

Click the menu icon on the top left and select the pursuits button. Click the name of the pursuit you just added. 

Here, you can manage all aspects of the pursuit such as creating and assigning tasks to teammates, viewing recent activity, viewing pursuit files, checking compliance items, and responding to the pursuit itself. 

On the overview page, click the `+` button next to My Tasks to create your first task. Once finished, head over to the tasks tab to view the task card. 

Click the arrow button at the top right of the card in order to view the full task info. You can use this section to comment on progress and collaborate with teammates throughout the pursuit's lifecycle. As you work through each task, you can drag and drop the task card to update its status.

## 5.  Draft a response

Navigate to the documents tab on the pursuit manager. From here, create a new document just as you would on Microsoft Word or Google Docs. After creating the document, click into it to view the text editor.

This is where you can leverage Sweetspot's AI powered features in order to respond to the RFx. Our AI looks at the pursuit documents and automatically generates a compliance matrix, so that you know exactly what to address in your proposal. Our AI also ingests your organization profile that you filled out from Step 1 to help you generate responses to each section from the RFx, which you can leverage on the right-hand side of your screen.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
</Accordion>
